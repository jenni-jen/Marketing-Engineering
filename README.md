# Marketing Engineering
This repository includes projects about marketing engineering and analytics. These projects address popular marketing topics, such as forecasing car sales and predicting housing prices. Machine learning techniques, including linear regression, random forest, and clustering, are used in these projects.

For each project, the `R` file includes purely the codes, and the `Rmd` file includes both codes and detailed analysis.
