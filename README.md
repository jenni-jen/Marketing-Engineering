# Marketing Engineering
This repository includes projects about marketing engineering and analytics. These projects address popular marketing topics, such as forecasing car sales and predicting housing prices, by using machine learning techniques including linear regression, random forest, clustering, etc.

`R` files include purely the codes, and `Rmd` files include both codes and detailed analysis.

*Due to privacy issues, datasets used in these projects will not be uploaded.*
