# Marketing Engineering
This repository includes projects about marketing engineering and analytics. These projects address popular marketing topics, such as forecasing car sales and predicting housing prices, by using machine learning techniques including linear regression, random forest, clustering, etc.

For each project, the `R` file includes purely the codes, and the `Rmd` file includes both codes and detailed analysis.
